# Dog-Rates-Twitter-Analysis

 Exploratory analysis of tweets from the twitter handle @dog_rates. This was a project done during my Nanodegree programme at Udacity. The data was queried through the twitter API using Python (Tweepy) and has been assessed, cleaned, analyzed and visualized.

 The details can be found [here](wrangle_act.ipynb).
